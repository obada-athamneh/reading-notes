# Version Control

## Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.


Version Control                | Difinition 
-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------
Local Version Control          |entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
Centralized Version Control    |This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions.
Distributed Version Control    |allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers working in teams.

# Workflow

## Local Repository Structure has three components:

1. Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
2. Index: The area used for staging
3. Head: Points to the most recent commit
