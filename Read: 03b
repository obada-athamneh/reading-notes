## summary HTML 

1. HTML pages are text documents.
2. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
3. Tags are often referred to as elements.
4. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
5. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
6. Attributes require a name and a value.
7. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.


 ## HTML5 is introducing a new set of
elements that help define the structure of
a page.
 
### They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML
elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find
it easier to understand how they can be used now that you
have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These
new elements are going to play an important part in creating
layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see: 

1. The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
2. How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element
3. How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements

you can use when you are creating a new
website.

* It looks at who might be visiting your site and how to ensure

1. How to understand the audience your site may attract and
what information they will expect to find on it
2. How to organize information so that visitors can find what
they are looking for
3. Design theory for presenting information in a way that
helps visitors achieve their goals
