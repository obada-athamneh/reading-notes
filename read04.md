# JAVASCRIPT

## How JAVASCRIPT Makes web Pagages more interactiive.

1. ACCESS CONTENT 

* You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. For example: 

1. Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
2. Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
3. Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of ema i 1

2. MODIFY CONTENT 

* You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them. For example:

1. Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element
2. Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
3. Change the size or position of an
<i mg> element 

3. PROGRAM RULES 

* You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page. For example:

1. A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
2. A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a form, perform a
ca lculation, and display repayments.
3. An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport). 

4. REACT TO EVENTS

* You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred. For
example, it could be run when:

1. A button is pressed
2. A link is clicked (or tapped) on
3. A cursor hovers over an element
4. Information is added to a form
5. An interval of time has passed
6. A web page has finished loading
