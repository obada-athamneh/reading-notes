#  how to
make your web pages more attractive,
controlling the design of them using CSS.

* CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear . For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

## CSS Associates Style
rules with HTML
elements

* CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts:

1. selector

* Selectors indicate which
element the rule applies to.
The same rule can apply to
more than one element if you
separate the element names
with commas

2. declaration.

* Declarations indicate how
the elements referred to in
the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two
parts (a property and a value),
and are separated by a colon.

* p {
 font-family: Arial;}

## CSS Properties Affect
How Elements Are
Displayed

* CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

Property Value

1. Properties indicate the aspects
of the element you want to
change. For example, color, font,
width, height and border

2. Values specify the settings
you want to use for the chosen
properties. For example, if you
want to specify a color property
then the value is the color you
want the text in these elements
to be.
